This repo contains tutorials/examples of flow matching and diffusion models of different complexities, starting from general models on simple distributions with easy-to-learn pushforwards and more complex models trying to understand Riemannian Flow Matching and Diffusion.


To run the code, python 3.10 is required. 

Other packages required are:
- pytorch 2.8
- torch_geometric 
- pandas
- matplotlib
- rdkit
- e3nn

Some related repositories are added as git submodules, if needed, run ````git submodule update --init --recursive```` to clone them into the submodules directory.
