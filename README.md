This repo contains tutorials/examples of flow matching and diffusion models of different complexities, starting from general models on simple distributions with easy-to-learn pushforwards and more complex models trying to understand Riemannian Flow Matching and Diffusion.


To run the code, python 3.10 is required. 

Other packages required are:
- pytorch 
- torch_geometric
- pandas
- matplotlib
- rdkit
- e3nn

I used PyTorch 2.8 for the snippets, with CUDA 12.6, the choice was based on the requirements of torch_geometric (PyTorch < 2.8 ---> Python <=3.10).
